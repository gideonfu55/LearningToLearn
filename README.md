# Learning to Learn
Project based on Learning to Learn Coursera Course

This is a project based on the lessons I've learnt in a coursera course - Learning How to Learn by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski. 
I have benefited from this course immensely and hope to apply some of these lessons in my web development learning journey. 

If you are interested, the MOOC can be enrolled here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn.

Cheers!
